# Hi, I'm [Germán] 👋

I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data at CPIFP Alan Turing. I'm deeply passionate about data analysis, working with datasets, and artificial intelligence. My preferred platforms include AWS, Power BI, Excel, and SQL, along with Python as my main programming language. I'm aspiring to become a Data Scientist, contributing to innovative solutions driven by data insights.
